# DataStructure - HashTable / Tree
## This program will manipulate template data using a Hashtable of Binary Search Trees.

**This program is aimed to demonstrate my understanding of the following concepts:**
- File handling (input and output)
- Use of public C++ libraries such as unordered_map
- Object Oriented Programming
- Binary Search Tree datatype functions (add, size, contains, traverse, lookup, remove)
- Hashtable datatype functions (add, remove, getItem, contains, size, traverse)
- Template data type

**This program will prompt for an input file and will generate an output file ("output.txt") with results from user executed commands in the IDE.**

remove() and getitem() are still in development

*Debug code has been intentionally left in and commented out to provide logic process and debugging resources for further development in the future*
